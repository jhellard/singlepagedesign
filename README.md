## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/) - Carousel Library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This challenge helped me further improve my knowledge of CSS Grid and building projects using design files. The carousel was a struggle, ended up using SwiperJS to incorporate it.

### Useful resources
